# Godot drone thing!

**Big thanks to this repo and its contributors: https://github.com/ahopness/GodotRetro**

I'm using Godot 4.2 to make this. Please note that when I say drone I mean quadcopter, and when I say quadcopter I mean cool racing quadcopters with no stablisation whatsoever.

Have fun working out how to fly in this game.

**Disclaimer:** I've never flown a proper racing drone in acro mode before, so I have no idea whether this flight model is accurate or not. That's why I'm not calling it a simulator. I'm calling it a game, or a thing.

Currently, controls are only supported for a twin-stick gamepad (I've been using a Logitech F710. Hm? Why are you laughing? I'm not joking. I actually am using one.)
